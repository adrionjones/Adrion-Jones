# Hello I'm Adrion 👋

I’m starting in cybersecurity, in the third quarter of my 2nd year, with a focus on **SOC analyst skills** — things like monitoring, detection engineering, and incident response.  

Currently, I spend most of my time building home labs, reviewing logs, and configuring detection rules in tools such as Splunk and Sysmon. In the future, I aim to transition into **penetration testing**, so I’m also learning how attackers think and documenting red-team style simulations.

---

## 🔍 What I’m working on
- **Splunk SIEM Playbook** — a lab environment where I test detections for brute-force logins, suspicious processes, and other common attacks.  
- **Windows Forensics Lab** — analyzing Sysmon logs and using Python scripts to spot odd behavior like encoded PowerShell.  
- **Security Automation Tools** — small Python utilities for parsing logs, scanning test environments, and handling IOCs.  
- **CTF Writeups** — step-by-step notes from TryHackMe and HackTheBox challenges (my way of practicing offensive skills).  

---

## 🌱 Goals
- Keep sharpening my SOC skills by building detections and incident response playbooks.  
- Learn to think like an attacker by simulating real-world techniques in my lab.  
- Transition into a **junior penetration tester role** once I’ve built a strong defensive foundation.

> I believe the best security pros understand both sides — how to defend and how to attack. That’s the journey I’m on.
